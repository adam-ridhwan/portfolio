        I build responsive and modern web applications that is user-centric ranging from blog applications to

        intuitively implemented UX design.

        My passion for coding started during my music degree. One of the classes I enjoyed was not music
        related at all. I took a Web Development class, which piqued my interest on building websites. Ever
        since then, I went on a deep dive on coding and web development. Now, I strive to learn as much as I
        can and make great code.

        When I am not coding on my computer, I like to play badminton on the weekends with my girlfriend,
        chilling at home with my cats, or go hiking in the 4000ft peaks at New Hampshire.
